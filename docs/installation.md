# Installation

For syntax highlighting in VSCode:
[Install Kataru Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Kataru.vscode-kataru)

## Unity users
1. If your project is not a git repo, clone [Unity-Kataru](https://github.com/kataru-lang/unity-kataru) directly into your Assets. Otherwise, run the following command from the root of your Unity project to add it as a submodule:
```
git submodule add https://github.com/kataru-lang/unity-kataru <path> 
```
where `<path>` points to a directory inside of your project's `Assets` folder.
2. Become familiar with <a href="#/api/unity?id=kataru-settings">Project Settings/Kataru Settings</a>.

## Non-Unity users
