# Kataru 「カタル」 The minimal dialogue engine written in Rust.
- Simple and lightweight
- Organize dialogue, state, characters, and commands into local namespaces
- Syntax highlighting and Unity integration
  
As well as conditionals, variables, and everything else you expect in a dialogue language.


> [!WARNING]
> Using Kataru in your project requires linking a WASM library or Native DLL, which means builds like Unity WebGL are not supported at this time.
